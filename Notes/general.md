# Location Covers
AICoversData.GetIndexes combined with AICoversData.GetVoxelesExtended should get us the voxels around a world pos.

AICoversData itself is accessible on BotsController.CoversData_1

!!! Also get all shrubs and trees in the vicinity. The cover point will be the point 1m away from the tree towards the objective. Shrubs we'll just hang out in the middle.

## Standing Cover
- Look at any visible doors
  - The scan angle here will be 0 deg
- Look away or at the objective (whichever has longer LOS)
  - Scan angle 20-30 deg?
- Away from the wall if nothing else works
  - Scan angle 45 deg
- Some bots should also crouch

!! The scan angle defines an angle in which the bot will choose look directions in random 1-5 second intervals and look at (with slow/smooth change)

## Crouched Cover
- Look at any visible doors, the objective (or away if that's farther) or if none are visible, away from the wall.
- Most bots should crouch

Ignore prone cover for now.

class CoverPoint
- Position
- CoverType (bsg - trees count as walls)
- CoverLevel (bsg)
- WallDirection (don't use for shrubs)

# GuardReposition
Grab a random GroupPoint near the location.

# GuardWatch
Will either look at the objective, a visible door or in the opposite of the wall direction in the GroupPoint with a gentle random sweeping sway in an ellipse that 30 deg tall and 60 deg wide.

# Formation Movement
We now have a squad leader, so we can anchor everything to this.

* Only the squad leader gets the objectives. Make sure to add a condition to the score that prevents other bots getting it.
* Other bots will have FollowSquadLead action, where the formation movement will be built.
* The squad itself will decide on and set up the formations. It'll choose between diamond and other formations.
* Formations will always be built one step ahead, so that the various path checks can be done asynchronously.

Formation Types:
* Diamond formation: if the next corner is more than 5m away
* Column formation: if it's less than that. This formation will simply cause the non squad lead bots to go the next corner.

Formation Logic:
* Calculate the formation targets 1 step ahead using navmesh raycasts.
* The bot will be moving to the current formation target
* We'll also calculate idealized current positions around the squad lead which will track where the squad members should be in any given time. They'll slow down and speed up to be close to these points.

Bot Move Notes:
* If the squad lead detects low cohesion, it'll slow down
* Other bots will maintain speed, unless they are within 1m of the current formation position, in which case they'll match the squad lead speed.

# Looting
Look at GClass117 (LootPatrol layer) on how to implement looting

# General Notes
* Don't use the bot.Position as it seems to be lagging. Use the Player.Position instead.
